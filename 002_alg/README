This problem is intended for you to practice the
basics of algorithmic development and execution
by hand that you learned in Chapter 1.

Here is what you need to do:

 (1) Find your partner. Do:
       my-partner 002_alg
     and you will see your group number and your partner's netID.
 (2) You should do Group A Problem 1, and your partner should do
     Group B Problem 1. When you are both finished writing your
     algorithm and executing it for N=6, swap with your partner. 
     Execute your partner's algorithm and compare answers.
     Did you get the same answers?
     Was something ambiguous in the algorithm?
     Did you find the patterns correctly?
 (3) Now that you have practice developing a simple algorithm, do
     Group A Problem 2. When you and your partner are both finished,
     swap and compare as before.
 (4) When you and your partner are both satisfied with your
     respective Problem 2s, create a file answers.txt, and write four
     lines in it:
     - Your answer for N=7
     - Your answer for N=8
     - Your partner's answer for N=7
     - Your partner's answer for N=8
     Each line should consist only of the integers in the sequence,
     each separated by a space.
     
After you have done that, save the file, add it to git, commit it,
push it, and request it to be graded (if you do not remember how,
look back at 000_submit).

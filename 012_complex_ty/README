Create a file called mytypes.c, and write declarations for the
following types in it:

(1) A struct for a complex number, called complex_num_tag, which has
    a double for the real part (called real_part) and a double for
    the imaginary part (called imaginary_part).
    Then, create a typedef for this struct which makes complex_num_t
    an alias for struct complex_num_tag.
(2) An enum for animals, called animal_tag which enumerates the
    following constsants:
      CAT FISH SNAKE DOG HORSE
    Create a typedef for this enum which makes animal_t an alias for
    enum animal_tag.

Find a partner who is on the same problem, and check each other's
syntax. Then submit your mytypes.c file.
